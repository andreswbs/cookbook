                <h3>Pizza Margherita</h3>
                <p>A widespread belief says that in June 1889 the pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito, Pizzeria Brandi's chef,
                    invented a dish called "Pizza Margherita" in honor of the Queen of Italy, Margherita of Savoy, and
                    the Italian unification, since toppings are tomato (red), mozzarella (white) and basil (green),
                    ingredients inspired by the colors of the national flag of Italy.

                    While the name Pizza Margherita may have been popularized because of the Queen's visit, a pizza made
                    with the same toppings was already present in Naples between 1796 and 1810. In 1830, in the book
                    Napoli, contorni e dintorni, written by Riccio, it was described as a pizza with tomato, mozzarella
                    and basil. In 1849 Emanuele Rocco recorded different pizza toppings like basil, tomatoes and thin
                    slices of mozzarella; the mozzarella was thinly sliced, and arranged with a flower-shape over the
                    tomato sauce, along with the basil leaves: this may be the real origin of the name Margherita
                    (meaning daisy).</p>

                    <p>How to prepare:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a
                            well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon
                            until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5
                            mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if
                            you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</li>
                        <li>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste.
                            Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
                        <li>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two
                            balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using
                            a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds
                            onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
                        <li>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned
                            baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon.
                            Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on
                            its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp.
                            Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining
                            pizza.</li>
                    </ol>
