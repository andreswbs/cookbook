                <h3>Spaghetti Bolognese</h3>
                <p>Spaghetti bolognese (sometimes called spaghetti alla bolognese, or colloquially 'spag bol', spaghetti
                    with meat sauce, or just spaghetti) is a pasta dish that is popular outside Italy, but not part of
                    traditional Bolognese or even Italian cuisine in general. The dish is generally perceived as
                    inauthentic when encountered by Italians abroad.

                    It consists of spaghetti served with a sauce made from tomatoes, minced beef, garlic, wine and
                    herbs; sometimes minced beef can be replaced by other minced meats. In this sense the sauce is
                    actually more similar to Neapolitan ragù from the south of Italy than the northern Bolognese version
                    of ragù. It is often served with grated Parmesan on top, but local cheeses, such as grated cheddar
                    are also often used. It may be served with a larger proportion of sauce to pasta than is common in
                    genuine Italian spaghetti dishes. The sauce may be laid on top of the pasta (rather than being mixed
                    in, in the Italian manner) or even served separately from it, leaving diners to mix it in
                    themselves.</p>

                    <p>How to prepare:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Put a large saucepan on a medium heat and add 1 tbsp olive oil.</li>
                        <li>Add 4 finely chopped bacon rashers and fry for 10 mins until golden and crisp.</li>
                        <li>Reduce the heat and add the 2 onions, 2 carrots, 2 celery sticks, 2 garlic cloves and the
                            leaves from 2-3 sprigs rosemary, all finely chopped, then fry for 10 mins. Stir the veg
                            often until it softens.</li>
                        <li>Increase the heat to medium-high, add 500g beef mince and cook stirring for 3-4 mins until
                            the meat is browned all over.</li>
                        <li>Add 2 tins plum tomatoes, the finely chopped leaves from ¾ small pack basil, 1 tsp dried
                            oregano, 2 bay leaves, 2 tbsp tomato purée, 1 beef stock cube, 1 deseeded and finely chopped
                            red chilli (if using), 125ml red wine and 6 halved cherry tomatoes. Stir with a wooden
                            spoon, breaking up the plum tomatoes.</li>
                        <li>Bring to the boil, reduce to a gentle simmer and cover with a lid. Cook for 1 hr 15 mins
                            stirring occasionally, until you have a rich, thick sauce.</li>
                        <li>Add the 75g grated parmesan, check the seasoning and stir.</li>
                        <li>When the bolognese is nearly finished, cook 400g spaghetti following the pack instructions.
                        </li>
                        <li>Drain the spaghetti and either stir into the bolognese sauce, or serve the sauce on top.
                            Serve with more grated parmesan, the remaining basil leaves and crusty bread, if you like.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
